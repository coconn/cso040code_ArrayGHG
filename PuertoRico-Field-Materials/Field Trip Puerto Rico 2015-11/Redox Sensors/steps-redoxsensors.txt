Redox sensor probe installation: what we did

MACRO STEP 1: Get the items



MACRO STEP 2: (In this case) Lengthen the cabling

Items needed:
- Copper wiring (AWG 16 to match current wiring, PVC insulation as thick as available)
- Soldering iron
- Solder (40:60 lead:tin, flux core solder, XX width)
- Clamp to hold wires are you solder
- Self-amalgamating tape
- Wire strippers/wire cutters
- Bucket for water
- Big thing of kitchen salt
- Multimeter

Connecting the new wire:
- We had sensors with 10 ft of cable length and wanted 30 ft of cable on each
- We cut 20 ft lengths of our new wire, then stripped the ends of the original cable and the new cable (~1 inch)
- We soldered the ends together
- To prepare to solder, we watched these youtube videos:

- We wrapped the join with self-amalgamating tape and let the wiring sit for at least 24 hours for the tape to have time to adhere to itself

Checking to ensure that the new connection is waterproof:
- After letting the tape cure, we submerged the wiring join into a bucket of very salty water (we dumped half a kg of table salt into a bucket - doesn't need to be exact)
- We let the wires sit for at least 24 hours


MACRO STEP 3: Install in the ground



MACRO STEP 4: Datalogger set up
